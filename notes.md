# 20200730 Graphik mit Python
----------------
- einsteigerkurs
- marcel, vorkenntnisse, mathematische kenntnisse
- vorkenntnisse, python, graphik, mathematik
- notes from webdrive (download them later)
----------------
- Python: easy to acquire the knowledge; leads quickly to results
- quick to develop also some GUIs and graphic-apps

content of the course:
- scientific-graphical area
- libs:
 - MatplotLib
 - tkinter (toolkit interface)
 - PyGames (animated graphics)

PyScripter is a IDE
others:
- Pycharm
- IDLE
- Spyder (from Jupyter)


Preparation:
$ pip install matplotlib pygmes
 tkinter problem?
 "The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems. (Tk itself is not part of Python; it is maintained at ActiveState.)"
- tkinter was aölready there: run
- $ python -m tkinter
- for a small preview window as demonstration

Plot with a marker; sin, cos, tan ... also quadratic things


problems with matplotlib for other users; therefore we switch immediately to tkinter:
